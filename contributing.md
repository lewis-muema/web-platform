## Pull Request Process

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Use [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) naming convention for CSS class names.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)


## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* Use [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) naming convention for CSS class names.
